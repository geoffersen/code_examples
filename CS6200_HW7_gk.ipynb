    "Consider the trec07_spam set of documents annotated for spam, available “data resources”.\n",
    "First read and accept agreement at http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/treccorpus07/. Then download the 255 MB Corpus (trec07p.tgz). The html data is in data/; the labels (\"spam\" or \"ham\") are in full/.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to think a bit about storage (recommended ElasticSearch, but not required). Definitely use library to clean the html into plain text before storage. You dont have to do stemming or skipping stopwords (up to you); eliminating some punctuation might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning Data is Required: By \"unigram\" we mean an English word, so as part of reading/processing data there will be a filter step to remove anything that doesnt look like an English word or small number. Some mistake unigrams passing the filter are acceptable, if they look like words (e.x. \"artist_\", \"newyork\", \"grande\") as long as they are not overwhelming the set of valid unigrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any library/script/package for cleaning, or share your cleaning code (but only the cleaning code) with the other students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to have a field “label” with values “yes” or “no” (or \"spam\"/\"ham\") for each document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Partition the spam data set into TRAIN 80% and TEST 20%. One easy way to do so is to add to each document in ES a field \"split\" with values either \"train\" or \"test\" randomly, following the 80%-20% rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus there will be 2 feature matrices, one for training and one for testing (different documents, same exact columns/features). The spam/ham distribution is roughly a third ham and two thirds spam; you should have a similar distribution in both TRAIN and TEST sets."

Issue 471 June 06, 2007 [Image] [Image] [Image] [Image] [Image] Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation [Image] (OTCBB: CCBEF) Dear StockUpTicks Reader: A recent acquisition by a leading beverage company of an organic baby food producer would seem at first glance an odd pairing. This may well have been the perspective of some investors when Clearly Canadian (OTCBB:CCBEF) announced that the company completed its acquisition of My Organic Baby, which has national distribution in Canada for its organic baby food products. But when you consider the market for both products, the health-conscious consumer, it appears that My Organic Baby might be the perfect extension of the Clearly Canadian brand, literally introducing consumers to the company in their infancy. Recent comments from James Dines of The Dines Letter affirm this belief, stating, The course has been set (for Clearly Canadian) and the company fully understands and embraces the exponential benefits available through the continuous branding of Clearly Canadian as a recognizable and trusted name in the organic and natural sector. See Breaking NEWS Below [Image]>> [Image] *BREAKING* News From Clearly [Image] Canadian Press Release Source: Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation Monday June 4, 8:41 am ET Clearly Canadian's Organic Products Takes off at Canadian Airports and Major Office Centres Organic Line to Be Sold in over 160 High Profile Retail Locations VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clearly Canadian (OTCBB:CCBEF - News; the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that its new line of Glengrove Organics dried fruit and nut products will be sold in all airports and many top office buildings across Canada through a new relationship with HDS Retail and its flagships outlets, \"Relay\", \"Great Canadian News\" and \"Express\". \"This agreement gives Glengrove Organics tremendous exposure, and provides another major step in the branding of our elite line of organic dried fruits and nuts,\" stated Brent Lokash, President of Clearly Canadian. \"HDS Retail has reported that 95% of people traveling into or through Canada via an airport will be exposed to their retail shops. This type of traffic creates an immense opportunity to build brand awareness, brand loyalty and increased sales with the potential for a great number of health conscious consumers to be continually viewing and buying products from the Glengrove Organics line.\" About Clearly Canadian Based in Vancouver, B.C., Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation markets premium alternative beverages, including Clearly Canadian® sparkling flavoured waters and Clearly Canadian dailyEnergy, dailyVitamin and dailyHydration Natural Enhanced Waters which are distributed in the United States, Canada and various other countries. Since its inception, the Clearly Canadian brand has sold over 2 billion bottles worldwide.

Clearly Canadian is well known as a leading producer of premium alternative beverages that all begin with one simple ingredient: pure, refreshing water. Its legendary line-up of naturally flavoured sparkling waters has sold over two billion bottles to date. Its newly-introduced line-up of premium, non-carbonated Natural Enhanced Waters are well positioned to make a lasting impression on the increasingly health-conscious beverage industry. In a strong indication that healthier premium beverages are supplanting soft drinks, Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) recently agreed to pay Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, $4.2 billion in cash and stock. The NEW Clearly Canadian: A Family of Healthy Choices Clearly Canadians recent acquisitions mark the companys debut to entirely new and exciting food and beverage categories. This new direction began with the February 2007 acquisition of leading organic and snack food company Sweet Selections- opening up some complimentary snacking options to go with Clearly Canadians premium line-up of beverages. In May 2007, the company acquired My Organic Baby Inc.  Canadas first full nationwide line of organic baby food. This innovative and fast growing line has over 30 product offerings listed in leading baby food retailers across the country and expanding to the US. Clearly Canadian is well into a major transformation into a diversified, branded company focusing on the way of the future: healthy, natural and organic products. Clearly Canadian now owns a group of premium brands in the beverage, snack and baby food categories that make up its family of healthy choices.

This program features one pound packages of such core organic items as raisins, sunflower and pumpkin seeds and an assorted dried fruit and nut mix. Glengrove Organics will initially be packed in sizes of approximately one pound or larger with future line extensions to include smaller packs aimed at the single serve snack category. David Reingold, President of DMR Food's, stated, \"We are delighted by the acceptance of this new program from an organization such as Loblaws. A leader in the health food category with stores from coast to coast, Loblaws is the largest food distributor in Canada. We are confident these large pack sizes will attract traditional bulk dried fruit and nut customers as a much more convenient packaging alternative.\" Reingold continued, \"I am convinced about the potential that the Glengrove product line has in today's marketplace. Our launch in Loblaws further validates our formula of starting with a quality product and adding great packaging, reliable delivery and excellent service.\" You may read the entire news release HERE ----------- Press Release Source: Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation Wednesday February 7, 10:30 am ET Clearly Canadian Acquires Eastern Canada's Leading Organic Snack Company Management Sees Diversity and Synergy Resulting from Strategic Acquisition VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation (OTCBB:CCBEF - News), (the \"Company\"), is pleased to announce it has acquired DMR Food Corporation. Operating under the name Sweet Selections, DMR is the leading seller of organic and natural snack foods in Eastern Canada. \"With the recent introduction of our Clearly Canadian Natural Enhanced Waters, including dailyEnergy, dailyVitamin and dailyHydration, a certified organic essence water, this acquisition accelerates our efforts to further establish Clearly Canadian as a provider of healthy, good-for-you, products,\" said Brent Lokash, President of Clearly Canadian. \"We see great upside in Sweet Selection's business over the next several years as retailers are placing a major emphasis on organic and natural products. With a growth rate of over 25% per year and a strong presence in Canada's largest grocery chains, Sweet Selections is an ideal complement to Clearly Canadian's brand recognition and established presence in the beverage sector. This combination creates a host of opportunities to penetrate our key markets and fulfills our stated objective to enter into the complementary snack food market.\" Mr. Lokash added, \"Our model for growth into the organic and natural foods market is to emulate what Pepsi/Frito Lay has done so well over the years in connecting beverages and snack food. We believe the combination of these two companies will provide a host of strategic opportunities to penetrate this exploding market and create value for our shareholders. Sweet Selections is a fast growing and profitable company. This acquisition will nearly double top line revenues with little immediate dilution to our shareholders.\" In connection with the acquisition of Sweet Selections, the Company has paid $450,000 CDN upon closing of the transaction; 3,000,000 warrants to purchase the Company's common shares at a purchase price of US $4.00 per share, provided that if a gain of $2,550,000 CDN is not realized from a sale of the warrants within 1 year from their sale of the warrant shares, the Company will pay any shortfall; and $450,000 CDN payable over 3 years. In addition, the Company has entered into a 3 year consulting agreement to retain the services of Sweet Selection's founder, David Reingold.

      " Dear friend I make this appeal with the understanding that any facts or opinion expressed by me are giving in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. I am Mr. Clive Buthelezi, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department where I work. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of amount in few millions in American currency, (US Dollars) with account number 8-32902701722 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great in industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three years and I am preparing documentation to prove that this money has been transferred to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you will know the money was not transferred into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and only a fellow white can stand as next of kin to him from the documents presented before us. In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 35% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 55% is for me. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application, which you will complete, and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear or anticipate that you will be sending me any funds, as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email. PLEASE DO NOT hesitate to contact me immediately should you consider my urgent request.

I am Mr. Clive Buthelezi, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department where I work. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of amount in few millions in American currency, (US Dollars) with account number 8-32902701722 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great in industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three years and I am preparing documentation to prove that this money has been transferred to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you will know the money was not transferred into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and only a fellow white can stand as next of kin to him from the documents presented before us. In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 35% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 55% is for me.

I am Mr. Clive Buthelezi, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department where I work. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of amount in few millions in American currency, (US Dollars) with account number 8-32902701722 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great in industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

It will be between me and you will know the money was not transferred into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and only a fellow white can stand as next of kin to him from the documents presented before us.
